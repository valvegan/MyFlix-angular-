# MyFlixAngularClient

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.7.

MyFlix is a small app that showcases various informations from a small database (REST API) of movies. Users can register, update/add information about themselves (securely via password hashing) and add/remove movie titles to a list of their favourites. 

The client-side for myFlix is developed using ANGULAR (TypeScript), HTML5, and SCSS

## Personal reflections on the project
This was my last project of the "full stack immersion" program by CareerFoundry. I found it quite time consuming and a little bit tricky, since I had to switch to a different framework after completing quite a few projects in React. I first had to learn the basis of TypeScript, and then dive into Angular and its component structure. Using Angular Material for the user interface has been extremely helpful, although I'm still not completely confident in working with it and it's been a tough leaning curve. Overall, I totally see how Angular with TypeScript can be extremely useful for complex and data heavy projects, but I feel like I do need more practice with it in order to master it at the same level I feel with React/Javascript.
